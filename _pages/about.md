I am a final year MS(Research) scholar at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Madras. My research interest lies in the broad spectrum of wireless sensing, focussing on radio (RF) imaging. Prior to IIT Madras, I completed my B.Tech in CSE from Government College of Engineering and Leather Technology, Kolkata.
